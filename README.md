# Furuta_Pendulum
In this repository there are code developed in STM32-CUBEIDE for the practical implementation of Furuta Pendulum.
Reading furuta_pendulum.c file could be useful if you want some tips about read angle and speed from a quadrature rotary encoder.
Moreover, if you are interested to how implement a PID, the function "calculate control torque" could be useful for you. At the end in the function
"Actuate control action" you can find some code-line for the control of DC MOTOR with a motor driver.
